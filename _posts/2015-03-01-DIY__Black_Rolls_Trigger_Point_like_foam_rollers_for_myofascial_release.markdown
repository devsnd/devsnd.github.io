DIY: Black Rolls/Trigger Point-like foam rollers for myofascial release
=======================================================================

I am a big fan of using foam rollers for [myofascial release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_Release "en.wikipedia.org - myofascial release"), especially after workout.

There are a lot of foam roller products for [myofascial trigger point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_point "en.wikipedia.org - trigger point") treatment out there, but I am too cheap to buy a piece of recycled plastic pressed into a cylindrical form for 20 EUR or higher. This is one of the easiest [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself "en.wikipedia.org - Do it yourself") projects possible, so make your own! 

The standard foam rollers of different sizes can be replaced with almost anything that has a similar form and supports your weight. I used [PVC tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride#Pipes "en.wikipedia.org - Polyvinyl chloride - Pipes") from a hardware store nearby. Just chose your preferred diameter, cut of the flange (using a [Dremel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel "en.wikipedia.org - Dremel") or a standard saw) and you are done.

[![Flange removed](/assets/images/Flange-removed-257x300.png)](http://fomori.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Flange-removed.png)Now for the back area, foam rollers exist in the form of two spheres connected in one point.

The small version can easily be replicated by putting two tennis balls into [nylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon "en.wikipedia.org - nylon") tights and tying a knot at the end. This might sound/look a little strange, but seriously it works well (although the tennis balls are almost a little too soft).

Happy foam rolling!
